# Getting Started with Python
The primary programming language of this course is Python. By default, we use Python 3 for the class. You can either use online python platforms such as Google Colab or set up a local python environment on your machine. Here are some resources for both ways. 

We will also offer a section to walk you through some of the tutorials. Details to be announced. 


## Google Colab

Google Colab is a convenient online Python environment run on Google Clouds, so basically there are no system requirements for it.

## Local Python Environment

We recommend installing Anaconda on your machine, which offers a clean and intuitive management of your python environment. For interactive development environments (IDEs), we recommend using Jupyter Notebooks. If you prefer a more C++ programming style, Spyder or Visual Studio Code are good choices of IDE.

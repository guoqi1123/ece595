# Quizzes
There will be six **in-class** quizes, and the worst one will be dropped. Each quiz is 30 minutes long. Each quiz will carry 8%. The quizes are conducted on the class right after the due date of the homework. During the quiz, I will ask you lecture questions. I will also ask you homework questions. For example, if in the homework I ask you to plot a figure, I may ask you to change a parameter and re-plot the figure. Quizes will be open-book, open-note, open-computer. However, with only 30 minutes, you probably will not have time to read anything besides answering the questions. So, please do the homework.
